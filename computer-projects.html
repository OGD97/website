										<h3>Simon Game</h3>
										<p>The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds. It was first introduced in the late 1970s and has since become a popular and enduring toy.
											The game consists of a small electronic console with four colored buttons (usually red, blue, green, and yellow). Each button produces a specific sound when pressed. The game has different modes and difficulty levels, but the basic gameplay is as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>The game starts by playing a sequence of colors and sounds. For example, it might illuminate the red button and produce a corresponding sound, followed by the blue button, and so on.</li>
		<li>The player must then mimic this sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.</li>
		<li>If the player successfully replicates the sequence, the game adds another step to the sequence, making it progressively longer and more challenging.</li>
		<li>If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button or fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game signals an error, often with a distinct sound or light pattern.		</li>
		<li>The goal is to see how long the player can continue replicating the increasingly complex sequences without making a mistake.</li>
	</ul>
											
											The Simon game is not only entertaining but also serves as a cognitive exercise, testing and improving the player's memory and pattern recognition skills. Over the years, various versions and adaptations of the Simon game have been released, maintaining its popularity as a classic and engaging electronic game which is why I chose to convert it in a code base game as a one of my projects.
